## FAQ

**Can AI-generated videos pass as authentic human-recorded content?**

Modern platforms like KreadoAI, Synthesia, and HeyGen produce remarkably realistic avatars with natural lip-sync, expressions, and gestures that casual viewers often cannot distinguish from real humans. However, careful observation reveals subtle tells like unnatural micro-expressions or occasional synchronization imperfections. Lighting consistency, avatar choice, and script quality dramatically impact realism—poorly written scripts or inappropriate avatar selections expose AI origins. Use AI videos transparently for corporate training, marketing, and educational content where authenticity matters less than efficiency and scalability.

**How do text-to-video generators handle complex scene descriptions with multiple subjects?**

Advanced models like Runway Gen-4, Veo 3, and Sora handle multi-subject scenes through improved spatial understanding and object consistency, though simpler platforms struggle with complex interactions. Break complicated scenarios into multiple shorter clips rather than single long descriptions—generate a wide establishing shot, then medium shots of individual subjects, finally close-ups of details. Avatar-based platforms like KreadoAI and HeyGen excel at single-speaker presentations but require workarounds for conversations between multiple avatars. Test platform capabilities with sample prompts matching your typical content complexity before committing to subscriptions.

**What video lengths can these AI generators produce efficiently?**

Most avatar platforms including KreadoAI, Synthesia, and HeyGen generate videos from 30 seconds to 5 minutes efficiently, with some plans extending to 30-minute maximum lengths. Creative AI models like Runway Gen-4, Veo 3, and Sora typically produce 5-30 second clips better suited for b-roll, transitions, and supplementary footage rather than complete narratives. Longer videos require stitching multiple AI-generated segments, though platforms like OpusClip specialize in repurposing long content into short clips automatically. For extended training videos or presentations exceeding 10 minutes, avatar-based platforms outperform creative generation models.
